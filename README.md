# UnityExtensionsLocalization
This is a localization system based on excel sheets.

You can use multiple excel files, each containing multiple sheets, and each sheet containing only parts of contents of parts of languages. As the localization system works, it reads all excel files in the Localization directory (include sub-directories) and merges their contents, which means the file organization structure can be customized.
And, you can preview localized content in edit-mode.
